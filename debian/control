Description: Ubuntu Indicator Plugin for Pidgin
 This plugin provides an Ubuntu Indicator icon, for use in the Unity desktop
 environment. Unity no longer provides a general purpose notification tray,
 so the standard Pidgin tray icon does not appear. The official Ubuntu
 alternative is an integration with their Messaging indicator, which
 consolidates status from multiple applications. I've found this indicator to
 be much less usable than the original Pidgin tray icon, so I decided to
 build this plugin to restore the icon's functionality in a maintainable
 way (in constrat to having to run a patched version of Unity).
